# PulseMeasure
PulseMeasure library for Arduino

The PulseMeasure library for Arduino was developed to provide an easy and reliable way to use external interrupts with pulse outputs from most any sensor or switching contacts. Designed to work with INT0 or INT1 in any interrupt mode (CHANGE, FALLING or RISING). 

It uses timer2 to provide false interrupt supression. Extremely noisy signals can be completely recovered without impact on performance.
